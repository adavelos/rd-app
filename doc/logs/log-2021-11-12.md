## Docker Volume

        - Postgresql data path: /var/lib/postgresql/data
        - Options: volume vs. mount vs. tmpfs
        - Volumes:
                (a) create volume (name)
                (b) in 'docker run' use that volume and map with a container directory
        
        - Troubleshooting:
                - attention with auto drop/create in persistence.xml => each time WF container is restarted, the schema is recreated, so the volume does not keep data
                - when volume is mounted, then it is recognized and the postgres container startup does not run the initialization scripts
                        => in order to re-create DB, re-create (remove, create) the volume and then start container with volume specified

## Bash Script: check outcome of JBOSS CLI:
        - last CLI command 'add data source' => json result, contains "outcome" => "failed" or "success"
        - capture last command's result: use '$?'

        - Troubleshooting:
                - JBOSS_CLI => returns exit
                - if we run JBOSS_CLI and we pipe with another command, then $? = status of the last executed command (and not the )
                => solution: set -eo pipefail
