## Application:

    REST:
        - Created RD Entry REST API (create / get)
        - Follow REST paradigm on HTTP verbs and URIs
        - Use directly domain model as input / output in REST [implicit covnersion to JSON by Jersey]
        - TODO: missing update / list / delete operations

    DATA LAYER:
        - Entity Manager and persistence.xml
        - Started with H2 driver [in-memory / built-in in wildfly]
        - Changed to Postgresql driver [after setting up postgres container]
        - TODO: complete CRUD operations

    MAVEN:
         - Single maven module / no parents
         - TODO: model to be transfered in separate JAR module

## Dockerize:

    POSTGRESQL:
        - docker image (latest)
        - publish port 5432 (temporarily / until compose is setup)
        - TODO: remove publish 5432
        - TODO: mount volume (or in compose?)
    
    POSTGRESQL Extension:
        - Created Dockerfile.pg to extend POSTGRESQL
        - Copy SQL scripts to be run in dedicated directory, auto-read by postgres (ordered by name)
            - Script 1: to be run by admin (postgrsql) and create user and adatabase
            - Script 2: to be run by user (rd_user) and create schema
            - Before running script 2: connect as rd_user
        - Entrypoint is not changed - it is inherited by the parent image 

    WILDFLY - Manual Setup:
        - Copy binary to deployments directory: auto-deployeed
        - Integrate Postgres:
            - Create module: create directory in modules, add JAR and module.xml
            - Create driver: standalone.xml
            - Create data source: standalone.xml
            - Update persistence.xml:
                *** attention: the dialect must be set:
> `<property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect"/>`

    WILDFLY - Docker:
        - Extension is more complicate as expected
        - Downloaded sample project: https://github.com/BITFORCE-IT/WildFlyApp.git
        - Study sample project
